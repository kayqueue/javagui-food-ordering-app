Steps to do BEFORE pulling the new main branch

1. Open intelliJ and close the current open project so you see the intro screen
2. Now you can pull the new main branch

Steps to do AFTER pulling the new main branch

1. Open the Hopium folder with IntelliJ
2. Wait awhile after IntelliJ opens the project
3. There should be a prompt that appears at the bottom left asking to load maven script
4. Click load maven script and let it download any plugins and dependencies (might take a long time)
5. Once done, at the top of the right sidebar should have a maven option
6. Click that and navigate to Hopium -> Lifecycle and double click the install option
7. Let the install script run
8. Once finished you should be done

There should be 2 configurations in already added, HopiumRestaurant and StaffTest
I set these configurations to save as project file so we can share it.
